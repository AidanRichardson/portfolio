			"description": "As a 1st Line at Network I worked in a small team to provide IT support to over 1500 end users and machines. I had to learn quickly and be adaptable as I was on the phones helping clients within my first month on the job. I spoke to a large range of clients from junior staff to chief executives, testing my communication skills. I learnt to demystify complex systems to make them easy for users to understand. Early on, I understood the importance of utilising the skills of my team members, allowing me to get the job done more effectively as well as developing my skills to make my work better in the future. By working at a smaller company it has allowed me to mature quickly by experiencing some challenging situations and learning from them. It allowed me to see the ins and outs of a company as well as understanding my role in a team."
